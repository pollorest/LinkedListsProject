# LinkedListsProject
This is a project in which through the use of simply linked lists, we create a new user and a new password and we can perform multiple tasks with them such as enter them, search them, delete them and visualize them. This list is saved in a text file and makes changes to it that I make in the list. It saves the previous users when re-running the program in the txt.
